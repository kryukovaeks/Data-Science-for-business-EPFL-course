Aspects of this project were first posed as a Kaggle challenge and the data comes from [Kaggle DonorsChoose.org Application Screening challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening/data). We have changed the nature of what you need to do in this assignment (so it does not track what was done in the Kaggle Challenge), but nevertheless using or referring to the Kaggle Challenge repository is not allowed for the assignment.\n",

    "Founded in 2000 by a high school teacher in the Bronx, DonorsChoose.org empowers public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. At any given time, there are thousands of classroom requests that can be brought to life with a gift of any amount. DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website. In this assignment, you will analyze the text of the essays and requirements from each proposal."

Our school is big on curriculum compacting and helping  gifted kids move faster and struggling kids get the extra help they need. We would benefit so much from your donation. Every little bit helps us reach our goal. I teach Science to all 88 5th grade students and have clusters of 25 new students every 8 weeks. Your donation will help more than just one 5th grade class it will help several students not to mention the students in years to come.\\r\\nWe are looking to add some 3Doodler to our classroom. It would be wonderful to have our own set of 3Doodler. In order to help our students achieve our mission. Our school is big on using technology to help students express what they have learned through a medium of their choice. Having these 3Doodler in our class my fast and advanced learners will be able to go ahead and start the project while I help the other students get their. The 3Doodler will also allow each one of my students find a medium to help them learn and retain the knowledge.</td>\n",

The students range from being enrolled as a kindergarten-8th grade.

The proper equipment in PE is not always possible so this is why we are here asking for your help with shelving.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project is \\\"kid-inspired\\\" in that they want better fitness.  They look back at their PE class and said that is only 30 minutes each day.  They go to an extended day school year-round school which after 3:00 in the afternoon they have 30 minutes for more physical activity.  They said they need more equipment to be active with.  The students being \\\"kid inspired\\\" want a variety of equipment for life changing physical activity.The student's project which is totally \\\"kid-inspired\\\"decided they needed more equipment to keep the them active and gaining better health.  This \\\"kid-inspired\\\", they realized they needed 60 minutes of physical activity in school, and they are going to make it happen.  They get 30 minutes in Pe daily so they have to come up with 30 minutes more.  They are not getting it when they go home because their extended day at school.  The students said they need more equipment because they do not have what is needed in school presently.  The variety of activity equipment,a large variety of balls, and a  parachute is what the students are asking for.  This equipment will increase peer-to-peer learning among students.  This is very important building leaders within our school and community.\\r\\nIncreasing activities in all the students will help each student have better health with 60 minutes of daily physical activity.    The physical activity is what all the students are talking about.  Getting more!\\r\\nThe peer-to-peer learning building leaders and happiness within our school being everyone is active.

       "0  Most of my kindergarten students come from low-income households and are considered \\\"at-risk\\\". These kids walk to school alongside their parents and most have never been further than walking distance from their house. For 80% of my students, English is not their first language or the language spoken at home. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my kindergarten kids have many obstacles in front of them, they come to school each day excited and ready to learn. Most students started the year out never being in a school setting. At the start of the year many had never been exposed to letters. Each day they soak up more knowledge and try their hardest to succeed. They are highly motivated to learn new things every day. We are halfway through the year and they are starting to take off. They know know all letters, some sight words, numbers to 20, and a majority of their letter sounds because of their hard work and determination. I am excited to see the places we will go from here!I currently have a differentiated sight word center that we do daily during our literacy stations. The students have activities that relate to whatever sight word list they are on. This is one of their favorite station activities. I want to continue to provide the students with engaging ways to practice their sight words. \\r\\n\\r\\nI dream of having the students use QR readers to scan the sight words that they are struggling with and the Ipods reading the sight words with them. This would help so many of my students by giving them multiple exposures to the words. My students need someone who can go over these sight words daily and I can't always get around to everyone to practice their flashcards with them.

       "2  Our elementary school is a culturally rich school, with a diverse population of 580 students, in Pre-K through sixth grade.\\r\\nOur Title I school population has 92% of students qualifying for free or reduced priced lunches and a high concentration of English Learners.   We also serve two foster group homes for temporary and long-term placement of homeless children. \\r\\nWe do not see these statistics as road blocks. We see them as additions to our rich diversity.  Together we will help students to develop to their fullest potential: Creative, problem-solving,  compassionate adults.We strive to provide our diverse population of  students with not only extra curricular activities, but an outlet for them to express themselves creatively.As a teacher,  I have organized a dance club for lower elementary that meets once a week after school.\\r\\n\\r\\n This gives the girls something to look forward to, fosters the education of the whole child, and creates a social environment for our varied cultural student body. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince beginning our dance club, I have watched our girls who normally are introverts, bloom with excitement. They are also choreographing dances and productions in content areas during the school day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3  Hello;\\r\\nMy name is Mrs. Brotherton. I teach 5th grade at Ascent Academy in Utah. We are a wonderful charter school that uses the students' interests to help them learn. We are always looking for wonderful teaching methods to help students.  \\r\\nMy students are wonderful. I have several levels in my class. Our school is big on curriculum compacting and helping  gifted kids move faster and struggling kids get the extra help they need. We would benefit so much from your donation. Every little bit helps us reach our goal. I teach Science to all 88 5th grade students and have clusters of 25 new students every 8 weeks. Your donation will help more than just one 5th grade class it will help several students not to mention the students in years to come.\\r\\nWe are looking to add some 3Doodler to our classroom. It would be wonderful to have our own set of 3Doodler. In order to help our students achieve our mission. Our school is big on using technology to help students express what they have learned through a medium of their choice. Having these 3Doodler in our class my fast and advanced learners will be able to go ahead and start the project while I help the other students get their. The 3Doodler will also allow each one of my students find a medium to help them learn and retain the knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4  My students are the greatest students but are socially and economically disadvantaged.  We are an inner city school being limited to doing all activities in (PE) Physical Education inside because we have violence at the location where our school is located.  All the physical activities the students are active with are within the school so we have to have a good program.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the students are either African American or Hispanic.  The students range from being enrolled as a kindergarten-8th grade.  Since Physical Education is important with one's success in school; all the students have PE class Monday through Friday every day.  The proper equipment in PE is not always possible so this is why we are here asking for your help with shelving.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project is \\\"kid-inspired\\\" in that they want better fitness.  They look back at their PE class and said that is only 30 minutes each day.  They go to an extended day school year-round school which after 3:00 in the afternoon they have 30 minutes for more physical activity.  They said they need more equipment to be active with.  The students being \\\"kid inspired\\\" want a variety of equipment for life changing physical activity.The student's project which is totally \\\"kid-inspired\\\"decided they needed more equipment to keep the them active and gaining better health.  This \\\"kid-inspired\\\", they realized they needed 60 minutes of physical activity in school, and they are going to make it happen.  They get 30 minutes in Pe daily so they have to come up with 30 minutes more.  They are not getting it when they go home because their extended day at school.  The students said they need more equipment because they do not have what is needed in school presently.  The variety of activity equipment,a large variety of balls, and a  parachute is what the students are asking for.  This equipment will increase peer-to-peer learning among students.  This is very important building leaders within our school and community.\\r\\nIncreasing activities in all the students will help each student have better health with 60 minutes of daily physical activity.    The physical activity is what all the students are talking about.  Getting more!\\r\\nThe peer-to-peer learning building leaders and happiness within our school being everyone is active.

       "0  Most of my kindergarten students come from low-income households and are considered \\\"at-risk\\\"  These kids walk to school alongside their parents and most have never been further than walking distance from their house  For 80% of my students, English is not their first language or the language spoken at home    While my kindergarten kids have many obstacles in front of them, they come to school each day excited and ready to learn  Most students started the year out never being in a school setting  At the start of the year many had never been exposed to letters  Each day they soak up more knowledge and try their hardest to succeed  They are highly motivated to learn new things every day  We are halfway through the year and they are starting to take off  They know know all letters, some sight words, numbers to 20, and a majority of their letter sounds because of their hard work and determination  I am excited to see the places we will go from here!I currently have a differentiated sight word center that we do daily during our literacy stations  The students have activities that relate to whatever sight word list they are on  This is one of their favorite station activities  I want to continue to provide the students with engaging ways to practice their sight words    I dream of having the students use QR readers to scan the sight words that they are struggling with and the Ipods reading the sight words with them  This would help so many of my students by giving them multiple exposures to the words  My students need someone who can go over these sight words daily and I can't always get around to everyone to practice their flashcards with them  With the Ipods they would still have a way to practice their sight words on a daily basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "2  Our elementary school is a culturally rich school, with a diverse population of 580 students, in Pre-K through sixth grade  Our Title I school population has 92% of students qualifying for free or reduced priced lunches and a high concentration of English Learners    We also serve two foster group homes for temporary and long-term placement of homeless children   We do not see these statistics as road blocks  We see them as additions to our rich diversity   Together we will help students to develop to their fullest potential: Creative, problem-solving,  compassionate adults We strive to provide our diverse population of  students with not only extra curricular activities, but an outlet for them to express themselves creatively As a teacher,  I have organized a dance club for lower elementary that meets once a week after school    This gives the girls something to look forward to, fosters the education of the whole child, and creates a social environment for our varied cultural student body    Since beginning our dance club, I have watched our girls who normally are introverts, bloom with excitement  They are also choreographing dances and productions in content areas during the school day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "0  Most of my kindergarten students come from lowincome households and are considered atrisk  These kids walk to school alongside their parents and most have never been further than walking distance from their house  For 80 of my students English is not their first language or the language spoken at home    While my kindergarten kids have many obstacles in front of them they come to school each day excited and ready to learn  Most students started the year out never being in a school setting  At the start of the year many had never been exposed to letters  Each day they soak up more knowledge and try their hardest to succeed  They are highly motivated to learn new things every day  We are halfway through the year and they are starting to take off  They know know all letters some sight words numbers to 20 and a majority of their letter sounds because of their hard work and determination  I am excited to see the places we will go from hereI currently have a differentiated sight word center that we do daily during our literacy stations  The students have activities that relate to whatever sight word list they are on  This is one of their favorite station activities  I want to continue to provide the students with engaging ways to practice their sight words    I dream of having the students use QR readers to scan the sight words that they are struggling with and the Ipods reading the sight words with them  This would help so many of my students by giving them multiple exposures to the words  My students need someone who can go over these sight words daily and I cant always get around to everyone to practice their flashcards with them  With the Ipods they would still have a way to practice their sight words on a daily basis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2  Our elementary school is a culturally rich school with a diverse population of 580 students in PreK through sixth grade  Our Title I school population has 92 of students qualifying for free or reduced priced lunches and a high concentration of English Learners    We also serve two foster group homes for temporary and longterm placement of homeless children   We do not see these statistics as road blocks  We see them as additions to our rich diversity   Together we will help students to develop to their fullest potential Creative problemsolving  compassionate adults We strive to provide our diverse population of  students with not only extra curricular activities but an outlet for them to express themselves creatively As a teacher  I have organized a dance club for lower elementary that meets once a week after school    This gives the girls something to look forward to fosters the education of the whole child and creates a social environment for our varied cultural student body    Since beginning our dance club I have watched our girls who normally are introverts bloom with excitement  They are also choreographing dances and productions in content areas during the school day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "9  My students are athletes and students who are interested in health and physical activity    In my elective class my students have a garden in which we grow our own food and make healthy meals within the kitchen   My students love cooking from scratch and being creative with their meals  Most of my students dont know how to cook from scratch but they learn all of the basics in my classroom   If you dont have health nothing else seems to matter For some reason in our kitchen the water comes out from the faucet white looking and not clear like most water that comes from the faucet   We are not exactly sure why that is but the students are wary of using that water for their cooking or drinking   After much online research we feel that the Berkey Water Filtration system would be an ideal solution to our water problem   Although the water in Compton is probably fine to drink it would be better for us to err on the side of caution and have our water filtered before we cook with it or drink it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
